  about: `
Hello, World! I am Yassine Kamouss — a Computer Engineering student passionate about building intelligent software and systems that merge innovation, generative AI, and DevOps into real-world solutions.  

With a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and modern web technologies, I focus on designing **scalable, high-performance applications** with clean architectures and intuitive user experiences. My stack includes **React, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Python, Java, and C**, along with hands-on exposure to **Docker, Linux, and cloud-native practices**.  

Beyond academics, I’m deeply interested in **generative AI** and its potential to reshape how humans interact with software. I love experimenting with AI-powered tools, automating workflows, and sharing my projects to explore the frontier between creativity and engineering.  

Some of my key interests include:  
- **Full-stack development** with React, Next.js, and Node.js  
- **DevOps practices**: containerization with Docker, CI/CD pipelines  
- **AI/ML applications**: generative models, intelligent assistants  
- **Systems engineering**: crafting robust, maintainable solutions  

My long-term goal is to grow into a **full-stack engineer** who bridges **AI, innovation, and system reliability** — delivering impactful products while contributing to the open-source community.  

Let’s connect and collaborate on turning bold ideas into powerful software!
